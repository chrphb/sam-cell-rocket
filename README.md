This is an implementation of the SAM pattern with [cell.js](https://github.com/intercellular/cell).

SAM stands for State-Action-Model, it could also have been named the Proposed-Acceptor-Learner pattern, using the Paxos protocol terminology. 

For more information on this design pattern, please refer to [this page](http://sam.js.org/).
